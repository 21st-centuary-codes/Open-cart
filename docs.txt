Frontend Dev Notes - Open-cart 🚀
Welcome, fellow frontend dev!
Hey there! You're part of something exciting! Open-cart is all about creativity, precision, and making tech shopping smooth and enjoyable. Here are a few things to keep in mind while working on the frontend:

🛠️ Code with Creativity
Don’t be afraid to get wild with your designs, animations, and interactions! Make it fun but still usable.

Maintain consistency with the provided styles but feel free to propose cool new elements.

📌 Leave a Note for the Next Dev
If you change something big, document it (either in comments or here).

If something feels tricky, add a quick explanation so the next dev doesn’t have to struggle.

📚 Things You Learned? Write Them Down!
As you work, if you pick up a new trick, a cool CSS hack, or anything useful, drop it in this file. It might help someone else later!

💡 Have Fun & Collaborate!
This isn’t just code—it’s a shared project. Keep it clean, structured, and friendly for future devs.
